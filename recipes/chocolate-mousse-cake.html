    <h2>About this cake</h2>
    <p>This decadent, melt in your mouth, chocolate cake is quick and easy to make, yet, will make your family and friends begging for more</p>
    <p>The best way I can describe it, is to picture a marriage between a brownie outside and a fudgy chocolate center. Delicious!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200g chocolate bar</li>
        <li>200g granulated sugar</li>
        <li>200g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>200g all purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grease a pan with butter and flour it, removing excess flour. Optionaly you can line it with parchment paper</li>
        <li>In a <em>bain marie</em> melt the chocolate with the butter</li>
        <li>Wisk together the sugar and the eggs, until creamy.</li>
        <li>Add the melted chocolate to the egg mixture, little by little, always mixing with a wisk.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and mix until homogenous.</li>
        <li>Bake in a pre-heated oven, 180 Celsius, for 11min. It will look very uncooked in the middle, but cooked on the edges. Let it cool slightly and flip it onto a plate. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Pairs very well with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.</p>
